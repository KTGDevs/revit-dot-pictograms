All symbols are sourced directly from the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA)'s [website](https://www.aiga.org/resources/symbol-signs), where they provide as of writing this **50 symbol signs** developed in collaboration with the 
United States Department of Transportation (DOT) to create universal symbols for common items, locations, services one may have a struggle to find. None of the symbols include any text as they are meant to be universally understood without the issue of language barriers. <br/>

**Revit** is one the most used architectural design and development softwares in the architectural industry. Being developed by Autodesk it is a very versatile software. However it appears they have decided not to or at least have yet to include basic universal symbols
that allow for quick and easy annotation without getting into the needy griddy of something like their built in areas or rooms to label a area/room. <br/>

After discovering the public and free pictograms I decided to convert them into Revit's native Family system (.rfa's) as symbols that will stay the same scale on the document no matter the scaling for maximum readability. As a basis I scaled them to .25 inches as that
should be the smallest size a symbol should be to stay elligble on something like floor plans or diagrams. <br/>
> I may return to create different sized icons (.50", 1", etc) in the future if I find these icons are too small.

### Changes to symbols
- Revit allows for symbols to be rotated easily 90째 in any direction with the press of the space bar when placing down the symbol. With this in mind I decided it would be easier to only import a single arrow of each type (bordered, not bordered) since it would be
counter intuitive to have 3 other direction arrows when a click or two of the space bar can do the same. This lowers the size of the repo and the list of symbols one may need to import into their project. <br/>
> I debated adding the 45째 arrows as snapping only defaults to 90째 meaning the user would have to use the rotate tool after placing each arrow to point it in the right direction, or will have to align the placement tool to a 45째 line somewhere in the project.

- The **Baggage Claim** & **Baggage Claim Check-in** symbols are identical so I only converted the **Baggage Claim** symbol and removed the check-in.
