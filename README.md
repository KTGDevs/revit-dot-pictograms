All symbols are sourced directly from the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA)'s [website](https://www.aiga.org/resources/symbol-signs), where they provide as of writing this **68 symbol signs** developed in collaboration with the 
United States Department of Transportation (DOT) to create universal symbols for common items, locations, services one may have a struggle to find. None of the symbols include any text as they are meant to be universally understood without the issue of language barriers.

**Revit** is one the most used architectural design and development softwares in the architectural industry. Being developed by Autodesk it is a very versatile software. However it appears they have decided not to or at least have yet to include basic universal symbols
that allow for quick and easy annotation without getting into the needy griddy of something like their built in areas or rooms to label a area/room. <br/>

After discovering the public and free pictograms I decided to convert them into Revit's native Family system (.rfa's) as symbols that will stay the same scale on the document no matter the scaling for maximum readability. As a basis I scaled them to .25 inches as that
should be the smallest size a symbol should be to stay elligble on something like floor plans or diagrams. <br/>
> I may return to create different sized icons (.50", 1", etc) in the future if I find these icons are too small.

### Changes to symbols
- Due to revit having 90Â° snapping when placing symbols I only added one type of each arrow style. **Up** and **Up Right** with **Borders** and **without Borders** (4 arrows in total). GIF explination below:

- The **Baggage Claim** & **Baggage Claim Check-in** symbols are identical so I only converted the **Baggage Claim** symbol and removed the check-in.

### Notes:
- 2/3s done with this project i found that the offical aiga website download page was missing the customs and immigration symbols from the pack and had to aquire them using the noun project website.
